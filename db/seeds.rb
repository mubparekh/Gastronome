Cut the butter into small pieces. Separate the eggs. Beat the egg whites very stiff with salt and sugar. In the last seconds before turning off the mixer, add the egg yolks. Add the milk and cream mixture to chocolate. Mix well until the chocolate melts. I recommend using a fou√© to stir the mixture until the temperature about 40 degrees, slightly warmer than its lip. Add butter and continue mixing until melted. Add a little of the chocolate mixture to eggs. Mix gently with a spatula silicon. Then add the egg mixture once the chocolate mixture, incorporating everything with gentle movements that do not lose the clear air. Mix just until uniform with a mousse. Transfer mixture to bowl in which you want to serve. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. It is recommended that one should serve the mousse within 24 hours because of the eggs. I think it will have no problem, because there will be nothing left!

Lay several spears of seasoned asparagus on a flat surface and thread skewer through spears.  One skewer near the top portion and one skewer near the bottom.  This makes for easier flipping. You may also roast the asparagus in the oven:  Place seasoned asparagus on a large baking sheet and bake in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the remaining sauce ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir well to dissolve the cornstarch. Gently pour into the saucepan with the fried ginger and garlic. Stir as you pour because the cornstarch will thicken up pretty quickly. Keep warm over low heat.
				In a heavy-bottomed pot or deep-fryer heat enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 375 degrees F.
				Fry the chicken, in small batches, until golden and crispy, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the chicken using a wire mesh strainer and drain on paper towels. Season with a little salt, to taste. To serve, arrange the fried chicken on a platter and pour drizzle with the sauce. Sprinkle with a generous amount of toasted sesame seeds and garnish with scallions and cilantro sprigs
